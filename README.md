# CPSC 369 Group Project

## Idea Explanation

Our group aims to examine the potential effects that a countryâ€™s emissions could have on the health of its citizens and residents. The control of our emissions is rooted in the environmental pillar of sustainability since increased emissions have been linked with rising global temperatures and habitat destruction (e.g., melting polar ice caps). Conversely, the concept of health and healthcare is entrenched in the social pillar of sustainability. By comparing these two aspects, we will assess the bearability (cross-section of environmental and social sustainability) of the current emissions rate on health.

## Datasets

### Dataset A: Health Risk Factors and Future Challenges

- **Link:** [World Bank - Health Risk Factors](https://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.17)
- **Description and Relevance:** This table provides a comprehensive overview of health risk factors and future challenges across various countries, covering data on the prevalence of tobacco use, the incidence of tuberculosis, diabetes, HIV, and the causes of death by communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries. The data offers insights into the health profiles of different countries' populations and demographics.

### Dataset B: Global Health Systems

- **Link:** [World Bank - Health Systems](https://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.12)
- **Description and Relevance:** This table provides comprehensive data on health systems worldwide, covering health expenditure, healthcare workforce, and health service availability and quality across various countries. It includes metrics such as public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, out-of-pocket health expenses, and the density of healthcare workers. The data offers more insight into the healthcare systems of different countries.

### Dataset C: Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions

- **Link:** [World Bank - Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.9)
- **Description and Relevance:** The table provides detailed data on global greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions, for various countries over recent years. This data is very relevant for understanding the scale of emissions by country, tracking trends over time, and informing policy and actions to address climate change.
